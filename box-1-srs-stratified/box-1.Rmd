# Overview

This box demonstrates how to estimate biomass,associated uncertainties, 
and 95% confidence intervals for a simple random sample, a stratified 
random sample, and for length weight data. Common to the 3 approaches is 
the use of a sampling frame (how many fish are there) and random sample 
of fish from the sampling frame. In short, the mean weight of fish in 
the sample is multiplied by the total number of fish to estimate biomass 
where the mean can be calculated as a simple random sample, from a 
stratified sample, or accounting for variation among all the fish in the 
sampling frame with a covariate like fish length. 

The data used in this example is from commercial common carp _Cyprinus 
carpio_ harvest in Clear Lake Iowa (Colvin 2012). Commercial harvesters 
capture common carp in the spring and fall annually to remove biomass 
from the system. The biomass removed from the system can be estimated 
using the 3 approaches. The sampling frame is the number of common carp 
harvested for each occasion. The sampling unit is individual common 
carp. 



# Estimating biomass for a simple random sample

## Setting up the data

The R code chunk below sets up the sampling frame and the data for the 
simple random sample. 

```{r}
# weight data in grams for the
# simple random sample
carp_weights<-data.frame(season=c(rep("spring", 180)),
    weight=c(0.611, 0.595, 0.601, 0.629, 0.63, 
    0.635, 0.65, 0.65, 0.65, 0.654, 0.63, 0.64, 0.67, 0.63, 0.648, 0.65, 
    0.634, 0.671, 0.759, 0.645, 0.645, 0.701, 0.66, 0.66, 0.666, 0.669, 
    0.674, 0.675, 0.677, 0.678, 0.68, 0.681, 0.71, 0.654, 0.662, 0.665, 
    0.671, 0.68, 0.682, 0.682, 0.633, 0.662, 0.665, 0.675, 0.65, 0.667, 
    0.681, 0.674, 0.674, 0.681, 0.706, 0.71, 0.698, 0.724, 0.663, 0.674, 
    0.694, 0.71, 0.72, 0.682, 0.685, 0.708, 0.692, 0.707, 0.712, 0.685, 
    0.687, 0.69, 0.702, 0.705, 0.73, 0.685, 0.694, 0.724, 0.725, 0.735, 
    0.745, 0.704, 0.715, 0.691, 0.715, 0.731, 0.747, 0.72, 0.725, 0.71, 
    0.713, 0.729, 0.73, 0.73, 0.705, 0.722, 0.728, 0.735, 0.731, 0.749, 
    0.776, 0.705, 0.751, 0.772, 0.754, 0.757, 0.76, 0.76, 0.79, 0.725, 
    0.739, 0.742, 0.743, 0.753, 0.755, 0.76, 0.765, 0.74, 0.745, 0.731, 
    0.745, 0.78, 0.72, 0.745, 0.755, 0.767, 0.78, 0.768, 0.79, 0.715, 0.766, 
    0.77, 0.79, 0.8, 0.823, 0.751, 0.779, 0.78, 0.795, 0.75, 0.766, 0.786, 
    0.684, 0.75, 0.757, 0.765, 0.77, 0.783, 0.79, 0.785, 0.799, 0.8, 0.76, 
    0.78, 0.81, 0.79, 0.77, 0.79, 0.78, 0.79, 0.79, 0.77, 0.797, 0.808, 
    0.819, 0.805, 0.805, 0.83, 0.82, 0.838, 0.846, 0.83, 0.818, 0.83, 0.814, 
    0.82, 0.821, 0.852, 0.796, 0.84, 0.833, 0.862, 0.86, 0.859)) 

sample_size<-length(data$weight)
# specify the sampling frame
# 3367 common carp captured but not weighed
# therefore the sampling frame is 2877+ plus the number of carped weighed
sampling_frame<- 3367+nrow(carp_weights)
```

## Estimating the mean and variance of the sample

The R code chunk below estimates the mean and variance of the simple 
random sample 

```{r}
# estimate the mean weight for the sample
mean_weight<-mean(carp_weights$weight)
# estimate the variance of the sample
variance_weight<- var(carp_weights$weight)
```

## Estimating total biomass 

The R code chunk below estimates the total biomass of the common carp 
captured as the product of the mean weight and the number of fish 
harvested (i.e., sampling frame). 

```{r}
biomass<- sampling_frame*mean_weight
# return the biomass estimate
biomass
```

The R code chunk below uses the variance equation provided in table 5.1 
to estimate the variance for the estimated total biomass. The standard 
deviation is calculated as the square root of the variance. 


 
 
```{r}
# estimated variance for biomass estimate
variance_biomass<- sampling_frame^2*(variance_weight/sample_size)
variance_biomass
```

The 95% confidence intervals are calculated by adding the appropriate 
t-value given the sample size as the degrees of freedom. For a 95% 
confidence interval the t-value is calculated using the `qt` function 
given probabilities of 0.025 and 0.975. The probabilities for the lower 
and upper are specified and the degrees of freedom is the sample size. 
The lower and upper 95% confidence interval are calculated by adding the 
product of the lower and upper t value and the standard deviation for 
the total biomass estimate. 



```{r}
# t-value 
# note the lower value is negative and the upper is positive
t_value<-qt(p=c(0.025,0.975), df=sample_size)
# calculate the lower and upper 95% confidence interval for
# the biomass estimate
lower_95_ci<- biomass+t_value[1]*sqrt(variance_biomass)
upper_95_ci<- biomass+t_value[2]*sqrt(variance_biomass)
```

The values below are the lower 95% confidence interval, the total 
biomass and the upper 95% confidence interval respectively. 

 

```{r}
lower_95_ci
total_biomass
upper_95_ci
```


# Estimating biomass for a stratified random sample

There are instances where stratification is necessary to estimate 
biomass. Continuing with the common carp harvest from Clear Lake, Iowa 
there were harvest events that occurred in the spring and the fall. It 
makes sense for annual reporting to report the estimated total biomass 
removed but there are differences in fish weight that should be 
accounted for in the estimate. Specifically, fish in the spring, after 
ice out, tend weigh less than fish in the fall after a season of growth. 
Therefore the time of harvest (i.e., spring, autumn) can be used to 
account for the weight differences that effect sample. Similar to the 
simple random sample the data required is a sampling frame and the 
sample random sample within the frame, but for each strata. For this 
example there are 2 strata, spring and autumn. In application this type 
of estimate can be used if there are weight differences between sex and 
among locations or life stages. 

## Setting up the data

The R code chunk below sets up the sampling frame and the data for the 
stratified random sample. The stratum weight is calculated
because it is need to calculate the weighted mean fish weight. The 
stratum weight is the number of sampling units in each stratum divided
by the total number of sampling units. 

```{r}
# weight data in kilograms for the carp harvested in the autumn
# 41 fish with weights and another 743 without weights
carp_weights<-rbind(carp_weights,data.frame(season=c(rep("autumn", 41)),
    weight=c(0.652, 0.632, 0.668, 0.684, 0.69, 0.695, 0.703, 0.698, 0.692, 
        0.714, 0.695, 0.74, 0.715, 0.729, 0.742, 0.713, 0.715, 0.745, 0.759, 
        0.761, 0.768, 0.725, 0.809, 0.775, 0.779, 0.798, 0.813, 0.795, 0.811, 
        0.811, 0.79, 0.801, 0.814, 0.835, 0.834, 0.83, 0.82, 0.853, 0.88, 0.88, 
        0.915)) )

# specify the sampling frame
sampling_frame<- data.frame(
    season=c("spring","autumn"),
    N=c(3367+180,743+41))
# calculate the stratum weight, do not confuse with fish weight
sampling_frame$stratum_weight<- sampling_frame$N/sum(sampling_frame$N)
```

## Estimating the mean and variance of the sample

The R code chunk below estimates the mean and variance of
the simple random sample taken within each stratum using
the `aggregate` function. 

```{r}
# estimate the mean weight for each stratum
mean_weight<-aggregate(weight~season,
    data=carp_weights,
    FUN=mean)
sample_size<-aggregate(weight~season,
    data=carp_weights,
    FUN=length)
# estimate the variance for each stratum
variance_weight<- aggregate(weight~season,
    data=carp_weights,
    FUN=var)
# return the stratum specific mean fish weight
mean_weight
# return the stratum specific variance
variance_weight
```

## Estimating total biomass for the stratified sample

The R code chunk below estimates the weighted mean 
of the common carp captured in the spring and the autumn. 
Noe that `sampling_frame` is not in the same order as 
the `mean_weight` and `variance_weight`. The `order` function
sorts the `data.frame` so it matches the output of the
`aggregate` function. 

```{r}
sampling_frame<-sampling_frame[order(sampling_frame$season),]
weighted_mean_weight<- mean_weight$weight*sampling_frame$stratum_weight
```

The R code chunk below calculates the overall mean fish weight. 
The biomass is then estimated as the total number of sampling 
units times the overall mean fish weight. 

```{r}
# overall mean fish weight
mean_weight<- sum(weighted_mean_weight)
# biomass estimate
biomass<- sum(sampling_frame$N)*mean_weight
biomass
```

The estimated variance for the biomass estimate is the sum of 
the stratum specific variance estimates. The stratum specific
variance is the same as the biomass variance for the simple
random sample, but in the case of a stratified sample applied
to each stratum. The standard deviation is calculated
as the square root of the variance and used in the 
calculation of 95% confidence intervals.  


```{r}
# estimated variance for biomass estimate
variance_biomass<- sum(sum(sampling_frame$N)^2*variance_weight$weight/sample_size$weight)
```

The 95% confidence intervals are calculated using the biomass
estimate, a t-value, and the standard deviation as was done
for the simple random sample. 


```{r}
# t value 
# note the lower value is negative and the upper is positive
t_value<-qt(p=c(0.025,0.975), df=sum(sample_size$weight)-1)
lower_95_ci<- biomass+t_value[1]*sqrt(variance_biomass)
upper_95_ci<- biomass+t_value[2]*sqrt(variance_biomass)
```

The values below are the lower 95% confidence interval, the total 
biomass and the upper 95% confidence interval respectively. 

```{r}
lower_95_ci
biomass
upper_95_ci
```



# Estimating biomass using a length weight relationship

Commonly a subset of fish captured are measured for length and weight 
and the remaining fish are measured for length only. This is 
advantageous as the variance for total biomass can be reduced by 
accounting for variability in weight among fish by exploiting the 
relationship between length and weight. The length weight relationship 
predicts the expected (i.e., mean) weight of fish where only length was 
measured and the estimate of total biomass then estimated by summing the 
predicted weights. The variance can be estimated as well and 95% 
confidence intervals calculated using the variance of the predicted 
weight. 

  

## Setting up the data

The data is 2 columns, length and weight for common carp in mm and kg 
respectively. There were xx common carp captured. Length was measured on 
all captured common carp and weight was measured for xx fish. 




```{r,eval=FALSE}
ylb_lw<-read.csv("yellow-bass.csv")
# look at the first few rows of the data
head(ylb_lw)
# plot the data

plot(weight_g~length_mm,data=ylb_lw,
    xlab="Length (mm)",
    ylab="Weight (g)")
# add a rug plot to see distribution of lengths
# that do not have lengths to verify adequate coverage
rug(ylb_lw[which(!is.na(ylb_lw$weight_g)),]$length_mm)    
```

## Fitting the length weight relationship

The expected weight for a given length is estimated by log linear 
regression in the R code chunk below. First the length and weight data 
are log transformed. Then a linear model is fit to the log transformed 
data. The data is visualized using the `plot` function. 



```{r}
carp_lw$ln_length<-log(carp_lw$length)
carp_lw$ln_weight<-log(carp_lw$weight)
plot(ln_weight~ln_length,data=carp_lw,
    xlab="Log fish length (mm)",
    ylab="Log fish weight (kg)")
```

A linear regression is fit to the log transformed length and weight data 
using `lm`. And the model output summarized and model fit added to the 
plot of raw data to visualize model fit. 


```{r}
fit<- lm(ln_weight~ln_length,data=carp_lw)
summary(fit)
plot(ln_weight~ln_length,data=carp_lw,
    xlab="Log fish length (mm)",
    ylab="Log fish weight (kg)")
abline(coef(fit)[1],coef(fit)[2])
```

The fitted model can be used to calculate the expected weight given the 
length for fish that were not measured for length using the `predict` 
function. Using the argument `se.fit=TRUE` in the predict function 
returns the standard error for each estimated mean weight in the data 
set. The standard error associated with each estimated mean will be used 
to estimate the variance for the biomass estimate. 



```{r}
# calculate the estimated mean weight for a fish of
# a given length
mean_weight<-predict(y,newdata=data.frame(ln_length=carp_lw$ln_length),se.fit = TRUE)
# take a look at the predicted mean weights and standard errors
head(mean_weight)
```

The biomass estimate is now the sum of the mean weights given the 
measured lengths. Recall though weight values remain on log scale.

```{r}
ln_biomass<- sum(mean_weight$ln_weight)
```

The variance associated with the biomass estimate is
the sum of the standard errors squared and is calculated
in the R code chunk below. 

```{r}
ln_biomass_variance<- sum(pp$se.fit)^2
```

The 95% confidence intervals for the biomass estimate are calculated
as previously done for the simple random sample and the stratified random
sample, but in this case the values are still on log scale.

```{r}
# t value 
# note the lower value is negative and the upper is positive
t_value<-qt(p=c(0.025,0.975), df=sum(sample_size$weight))
lower_95_ci<- ln_biomass_variance+t_value[1]*sqrt(ln_biomass_variance)
upper_95_ci<- ln_biomass_variance+t_value[2]*sqrt(ln_biomass_variance)
```

The real biomass and 95% confidence interval estimates can be
calculated by exponentiating each value to move from log scale back to 
kilograms.

```{r}
# biomass estimate
exp(mean)
# lower 95% confidence interval for biomass
exp(lwr)
# upper 95% confidence interval for biomass
exp(upr)
```
